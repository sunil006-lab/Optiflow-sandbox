# OptiFlow (AI-OrchestrateX)

**Project Stage:** 📦 [Alpha]  
**CNCF Status:** Proposed for Sandbox Submission

## Overview

OptiFlow (AI-OrchestrateX) is a lightweight, modular, and AI-augmented domain orchestrator built for cloud-native environments. Designed with Kubernetes architecture inspiration, OptiFlow offers flexible orchestration, observability, and domain-specific intelligence for healthcare, finance, manufacturing, and e-commerce.

## Features

- 🧠 AI-assisted intelligent scheduling and auto-recovery
- 🔀 Event-driven workflow orchestration
- 🔒 Secure etcd/SQLite3/Redis storage layers
- 🌐 Built-in API Gateway and Load Balancer
- 🧩 Plug-and-play architecture

## Architecture

The architecture consists of five layers:
- **API Server**
- **Scheduler**
- **Controller Manager**
- **Storage Layer (etcd/SQLite3/Redis)**
- **Networking Layer (Calico + containerd)**
